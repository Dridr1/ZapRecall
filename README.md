# ZapRecall

## What is it???
This is an Anki like flashcards game to memorize both React and JavaScript concepts.

In the first screen you can select if you want to play with a React or JavaScript deck. Then all you have to do is read the question, turn the card to check if you have memorized the concept and mark the card by selecting an option.
